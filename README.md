Fork of Wan2gp-Plugin Gallery from Tophness.

I've made some improvements to the plugin Wan2gp-gallery per Fork because: 
1. Every file was displayed twice for me.
2. I missed the ability to directly delete a file within the gallery

added
Jan 11, 2026
- Normalize the path to prevent duplicate file display
- Added direct delete function in the gallery for selected files

**New Update Jan 20, 2026:**
- Added two buttons "Use as start image" and "Use as end image" below the video preview.
These buttons send the current frame from the video preview to the input.
Useful for:
If you want to use a specific frame from any video of your choice as your start image or end image.
- Simply place your video in the WanGP output folder
- Refresh the gallery
- Select your video
- Then fast-forward to the desired frame in the video
- and click "Use as start image" or "Use as end image"

New Update Jan 25, 2026:
- Automatic switching of background colors for light and dark themes
- Button positions adjusted
- Delete button turns red as a warning when hovered over.

**The original Gallery plugin must be uninstalled first.**
